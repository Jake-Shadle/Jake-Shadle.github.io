      <description>&lt;p&gt;Though I have enjoyed reading coding blogs for years now, I have never thought seriously about doing my own, most
probably because the main language I use is &lt;strong&gt;C++&lt;/strong&gt;, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t really inspire me, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; been inspired by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/&#34;&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt; for about a year or so now (and still going
strong!). While it has been more than a year since &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/15/Rust-1.0.html&#34;&gt;1.0&lt;/a&gt;, there is
a still a huge amount of stuff that is improving on a daily basis, and as
&lt;a href=&#34;http://mgattozzi.github.io/2016/09/27/blog-about-rust.html&#34;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; points out, Rust needs more content of all
types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a wonderful conversation with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/steveklabnik&#34;&gt;Steve Klabnik&lt;/a&gt; and others about this a couple
months back when he came to Boston for the meetup. Someone had asked what one of the biggest blockades to adoption he
could see being in Rustâ€™s way. His answer was that we need people to talk about Rust and provide tutorials and projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought maybe this blog could be one way I could help the Rust community. Not only because they are a lovely bunch of
people, but also because I want to increase that community to include more and more C++ programmers so that the balance
eventually tips over and they start using Rust as their default language of choice when starting new projects or rewriting
old ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also when I attended &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rustfest.eu/&#34;&gt;RustFest&lt;/a&gt; I was struck by this quote from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ag_dubs&#34;&gt;Ashley Williams&lt;/a&gt; in her &lt;a href=&#34;https://intermezzos.github.io/rustfest2016&#34;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;teaching is nature&amp;rsquo;s way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something I have thought about before, but it definitely reminded me that I absolutely learn a lot more when I
want to relay information to a wider audience (mostly to reduce my chances of looking like a dumbass).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in conclusion, I guess I am writing this because I am selfish and want to use a nicer language when possible, as well
as improve myself, and my evil master plan is to write nice (and hopefully helpful) stuff about Rust. (I will try to
keep &lt;strong&gt;C++&lt;/strong&gt; snark to a minimum, but I have used the language for so long now, I think I deserve some leeway)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-rust&#34;&gt;fn main() {
    println!(&amp;quot;Hello, Internetz&amp;quot;);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
